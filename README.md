# Json file - Aorta
The purpose of this aorta calculator is to provide an estimated range of aorta diameter based on age, sex, and a data point input provided by the user. The calculator takes into account whether the ascending or descending aorta is being measured, and provides a range of expected diameters for men and women at specific ages. The user can then input their own data point to see if it falls within the expected range, or how far outside of the range it is. This calculator can be used as a quick reference tool for medical professionals to assess the health of the aorta, or for individuals to monitor their own health.
